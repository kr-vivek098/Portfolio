      <h1>Work / Experience : </h1>

      <p>
        As an <strong>Event Coordinator</strong> and passionate <strong>instrument player</strong>, I’ve had the opportunity to blend creativity with management across several college-level events and workshops.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the course of my academic journey, I have successfully <strong>coordinated 5 major college events</strong> and participated in <strong>2 creative workshops</strong> focusing on <strong>dance and music</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        My role often extends beyond coordination — I take pride in maintaining <strong>discipline</strong>, <strong>management efficiency</strong>, and ensuring every event runs smoothly from start to finish.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve also had the honor of <strong>performing alongside faculty members</strong> during small-scale musical workshops, which helped me grow as both a musician and collaborator.
      </p>

      <p>
        Previously, I served as an <strong>Event Leader</strong> in my former college, where I was recognized with a <strong>certificate of excellence</strong> for leadership and organization skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        These experiences have helped me develop strong <strong>teamwork</strong>, <strong>time management</strong>, and <strong>creative planning</strong> abilities — qualities that I now carry into every new challenge.
