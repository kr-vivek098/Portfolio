      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        Hello! I'm <strong>Vivek</strong>, an undergraduate student pursuing a <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science</strong> with a strong interest in technology and innovation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside my main degree, I'm also completing a <strong>double degree in Instrumentation</strong>, which helps me bridge the gap between software and hardware systems. This combination gives me a wider perspective on how technology works — from code to circuit.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m passionate about <strong>coding</strong> and continuously improving my problem-solving skills. I’m an active member of my university’s <strong>Coding Club</strong>, where I collaborate with peers, work on real-world projects, and participate in hackathons.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside academics, I love expressing creativity through <strong>music</strong> — I enjoy playing the <strong>guitar</strong> and <strong>piano</strong>. These instruments not only relax me but also teach patience, rhythm, and focus — qualities I carry into my coding journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe in learning, experimenting, and constantly growing as a developer and as a person.
